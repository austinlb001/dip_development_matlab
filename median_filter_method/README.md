# README for Median Filter

This folder contains the code for the median filter method.

The median filter is a filter that applies a window (typically 3x3) on an image. The window slides over the image and forms a new image by taking the median value in the window after each slide. Median filters are appropriate for denoising and edge preservation. The plan is to test this method by adjusting the window size.
